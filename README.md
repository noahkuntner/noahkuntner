- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Noah Kuntner, I am natively from Merano, Italy, and currently residing in Singapore. After completing my Bachelor in Economics, Management, and Computer Science Bachelor studies at Bocconi University in Milan, I have recently graduated from the Master of IT in Business as part of the Artificial Intelligence-Track at the Singapore Management University.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Macroeconomics, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Linear Optimization, Digital Democracy, and Information Asymmetry and other problems that can be tackled more optimally with a better understanding of business analytics and a more thorough application of decision theory.
